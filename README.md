# mcu_msp430_clock_screen
Triying to compile and simulate in Visual Studio 2022 a build for Proteus 8 in order to use a Low-power MCU as main controller for a base clock, the main obj is to properly use these mcu as ALU for oled screens.

The final objective would be a electronic device clock that properly is efficient and functional,
balancing energy and still offering a wide range of wise-IoT apps.
